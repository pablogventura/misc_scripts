#This script is intended to convert ape or flac + cue files to 
#ogg vorbis or mp3 files, setting the tags to the correct value,
#obtained from the cue file.
#REQUIREMENTS:
#	-Oggenc installed (it comes with vorbis-tools) if you want to encode into Ogg Vorbis.
#	-lame installed if you want to encode into mp3
#	-mac to decode ape files (Monkey's Audio)
#	-flac to decode flac files.
